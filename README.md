# Weather-App
This project is a simple Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data using the Open-Meteo API. The app allows users to check the current weather forecast for any location by entering latitude and longitude. Additionally, it includes a Geolocation feature that automatically detects the user's current location to provide weather updates based on their precise coordinates
